## About AYT automater
A simple program I made for a youtube video. It allows you to turn a script into a video using the PixaBay API for images and a text-to-speech library (pyttsx3). You can also use it for Instagram and Tiktok if you'd like. I may/may not maintain this and this will most probably be archived but if you want to remix this and share it, Feel free to do so! Just please credit the original work to me :)
